# 🎬 StreamHub 2024 — Retention & Revenue Analytics Dashboard

A full-scale analytics project built by **Deepa Mallipeddi** using synthetic data that simulates a modern streaming platform (like Netflix/Spotify).

This dashboard lets you explore:

- 📊 **User retention by cohort, plan, and region**
- 💰 **Revenue and ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) for retained users**
- 🌍 **Regional performance across US, IN, GB, CA, AU**

Built with **Python, Streamlit, Plotly, and Pandas** — and powered by a PostgreSQL-generated dataset with **75K users, 750K+ events, and 240K+ transactions**.
